LANGUAGE: POLISH for now.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS APP:
The purpose is to maintain and evolve the Medical Sector with AI and its possibilites.

NAME OF THE APP:
Heltica

Tried out the colors of the background and the elements on the site, it can be better, keeping a 20% focus on it.
Mostly spending time designing the layout of the website, functionality and which elements should be on the front-end.
Writing them all on a piece of paper, with a sketch of the web design.

Focusing on the layout of the app, trying out which colors would work.
Focusing on the small details, more user-friendly more work done for the doctors.
Trying to keep the app simple so that it won't feel overwhelming.

After doing some reseach the following steps were aproached:

1- Figuring out in which language the App will be written?

1.- React with Javascript, css and html for frontend and backend for the website, with bootstrap library for the css.
Wanting to implement AI, hoping to do so with Python, otherwise with Javascript.

=========================================================================

2- How to design the website with css?

2.- This question is rather hard to answear right now, the focus is on the component part at the moment.
The design will evolve with time.

=========================================================================

3- What will the app do?

3.-The app will be responsible for maintaining the whole medical ecosystem and making it user friendly.
By the usage of AI many things can be done differently, for an example it takes a lot of time for a
doctor to have a conversation with the patient and to write all the necessary information on the actual app.
With pHeltica the time of wrtining the necessary information on the app will be reduced to ZERO, by implementing
AI solutions, the AI will hear the conversation write the information and then the doctor will simply accept or
change if the doctor thinks that it should be something else.
A great ecosystem rely on the oportunity for the program to learn by itself. While the doctor changes the information
the AI solution can learn and possibly become an mighty ally in the future.

First thoughts:
My first big project, an app for helping medical doctors to keep track of the patients, mostly used for bureaucracy.
The common problem with doctors in Poland, is that they use 75% of their time organising bureaucracy instead of medical work.
This app/GUI is a great way to escape the Medical/Bureaucracy prison.
